  An aspect is a higher-order function with signature (fn [next-fn & args] ...)
  that can intercept, transform, or short-circuit execution before/after calling next-fn.
  This provides the full range of before/after/around \"advice\" patterns:

  - (fn [next-fn arg] (next-fn (before arg)))
  - (fn [next-fn arg] (after (next-fn arg)))
  - (fn [next-fn arg] (let [r (next-fn (before arg))] (after r)))
  
  Each aspect receives the nested result of all previous aspects as its first
  argument. Aspects can return (reduced val) to short-circuit remaining layers,
  preventing inner aspects from executing."
